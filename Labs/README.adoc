= Lab instructions

== January 8: Lab 0

=== Install Git and frontends

Windows:: https://git-scm.com/download/win[Install Git for Windows]
+
https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/releases/latest[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Select KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

Mac OS X:: http://git-scm.com/download/mac[Install git from here]
+
You may need to go to Apple menu -> System Preferences... -> Security & Privacy -> Open Anyway if you get an error.
+
http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev]

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below. To get into terminal on the Mac, it's Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.
Press `Shift-Insert` to paste in Git Bash.

== Lab 1: Discrete math review?

Lab 1. *Due*: By next Thursday.
Save your work in a file called `lab1.txt` in your repo.

----
cd ~/COMP1200-2016
touch lab1.txt
----

NOTE: Use
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html[a proper text editor],
https://atom.io[such as this].

=== Number representation

. Convert 1590 to binary.
. Convert 0b101110110 to decimal.
. Convert 0b1100 0000 0001 1010 0001 0101 1011 1010 1101 to hexadecimal.
. Convert 0b100 001 101 101 to octal.
. Convert 0o31337 to binary.
. Convert 0xBADF00D to binary and then to octal.
. Convert 0o6157 to binary and then to decimal.
. Convert 497 to binary. Then, use two's complement to convert 497 to -497 in binary.
. Convert 900.79 to binary up to the 1/16ths spot.
. Count from 0 through 10 in ternary (base 3). Note: the algorithm for counting is similar regardless of the number base. Show the place values.

=== Circuit design

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.
. Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.
. Write out the truth table for the minority circuit (it's true when the minority of X, Y, and Z are true).
. Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.

=== Boolean algebra

Use the laws of Boolean algebra.

. Show c + (b * c)' = 1
. Show (a + c) * (a * d + a * d') + a * c + c = a + c
. Simplify a' * (a + b) + (b + a * a) * (a + b')
. Show (a' * b') + (a' * b) + (a * b') = (a * b)'

=== Dual form

Find the dual form.

. (a + b)' + c * a' + 1
. 1 + 1 * 0'

=== How to submit work

Stage -> Commit -> Push

----
cd ~/COMP1200-2016
touch lab1.txt
git add lab1.txt
git commit -m "Added lab 1 solution."
git push origin master
----

== Lab 2: Circuit implementation

Implement these circuits from lab 1 in three different ways:

. Window -> Combinational analysis
. 8-1 MUX
. ROM

The circuits:

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.

. Minority circuit (it's true when the minority of X, Y, and Z are true).

Save your work in the `COMP1200-2016/Labs/lab2.circ`.

=== Submission

----
cd ~/COMP1200-2016/Labs
git add lab2.circ
git commit -m "Lab 2 done"
